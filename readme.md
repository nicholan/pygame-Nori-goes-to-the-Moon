# Nori goes to the Moon

2D Platformer game. Features 33 levels with changing visuals as you climb higher. 4 difficulty settings, adjustable mid-game, with 'easy' being a chill walk in the park, and 'hardest' possibly making you pull your hair out. Adjustable settings with display scaling, music volume, and on-screen level / 'altitude' toggling. Settings save to a config file. 

Only requirements are python 3.9 (may work on older versions), and pygame 2.0.1.

For me this project was practice on working with a state-based game and object oriented programming. 

### Known issues: 
Moving the game window will have the player fall through platforms.
